=Quirkey=

CircuitPython code for the Pi Pico version of the Quirkey keyboard, based heavily on the work done by Microwriter. The device emulates a USB HID US keyboard and requires no specific driver. It does however need the Adafruit HID CircuitPython libraries which can be downloaded from Adafruit's HID example web page or from Github.

The Microwriter and Quinkey were 6-key chord keyboards created in the 80's for use by people with various physical limitations such as brittle bones. They developed a following among all types of users being simple, reliable, easy to use, and effectively allowed instant touch typing at speed. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwriter

3D Files for printing the chord keyboard shell and assembly instructions can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433244

An Arduino version for AT32U4 processors is also available at https://github.com/VikOlliver/Microwriter.

The original Microwriter used an RCA 1802 CPU and LCD for the user interface, and uploaded via RS232. A TV interface was also available. The author (Vik Olliver) created the original Amstrad and IBM Quinkey drivers.
