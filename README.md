# Quirkey
CircuitPython code for the Pi Pico version of the Quirkey keyboard, based heavily on the work done by Microwriter.

The Microwriter and Quinkey were 6-key chord keyboards created in the 80's for use by people with various physical limitations such as brittle bones. They developed a following among all types of users being simple, reliable, easy to use, and effectively allowed instant touch typing at speed. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwriter

3D Files for printing the chord keyboard shell and assembly instructions can be found at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3433244

An Arduino version for AT32U4 processors is also available at https://github.com/VikOlliver/Microwriter.

The original Microwriter used an RCA 1802 CPU and LCD for the user interface, and uploaded via RS232. A TV interface was also available. The author (Vik Olliver) created the original Amstrad and IBM Quinkey drivers.
